Well, so pretty much this isn't the right place to learn how to code but it's better than nothing. And its also free!  

Our First Topic Is well JavaScript
It's pretty easy once you get the hand of it.
First: go to new tab on chrome and type up about:blank
This is where you test your code.
First do this in the searchbar: 
```
javascript:document.write("yourtexthere")
```

You can write volumes about it!
Our second one is how to make a button (it's very boring)
But, for this one, you have to use CodePen.
```
<button onclick="alert('You Clicked Me!')">Click Me!</button>
```

This is the blue version:
```
<button onclick="alert('You Clicked Me!')" class="btn btn-primary">Click Me!</button>
```

But In the end, they are the same thing.

That Is all for the first lesson.
